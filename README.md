# Fun-with-Zillow
In this Project, we will query from the Zillow API to get addresses for residential properties in Los Angeles, CA. 

This project will incorporate several machine and statistical learning methods such as RandomForest models, prediction modeling, simple linear regression, and more. Our goals are to measure and predict for the zestimates for residential properties in LA. Using variables such as the year built, square footage, lotsize, and number of bedrooms, possibilities of estimating zestimate values are endless! 

**Addresses.csv File will be uploaded soon. Need to decrease the file size**

**Please Note that you will need your own ZillowAPI and file destination for writing to the CSV files. **

**Also note that the daily maximum queries from the ZillowAPI is 5000. **

Your feedback is greatly appreciated on this project!
